# Privacy Policy

The use of this application ("Bot") in a server requires no collection specific user data ("Data").  
It only collects data pertaining to the server itself.  
Use of the Bot is considered an agreement to the terms of this Policy. 

### Saved Data

**Respawn Timer** only saves data specifically provided through the bot's settings and stores no sensitive data about users or events.  
Raidhelper Events are saved in the database when they are scheduled and are deleted when they are over.
The bot specifically removes all info from the Raidhelper API response that it does not need to display the events.

### Access to Data

Access to Data is only permitted to Bot's developers, and only in the scope required for the development, testing, and implementation of features for Bot.  
Data is not sold, provided to, or shared with any third party, except where required by law or a Terms of Service agreement.

### Storage of Data

Data is stored in a MongoDB database. The database is secured to prevent external access, however no guarantee is provided and the Bot owners assume no liability for the unintentional or malicious breach of Data.  
In the event of an unauthorised Data access, users will be notified through the [Discord Support Server](http://discord.gg/tcvd8CsA4N).

### User Rights

At any time, you have the right to delete the data stored for your discord server. This can be done manually in the bots settings by selecting the `Clear Saved Data` option.  
This deletes all data stored in the database. This functionality can be confirmed in the [source code](https://github.com/realdegrees/respawntimer/blob/develop/backend/src/widget.ts).

### Questions

If you have any questions or are concerned about what data might be being stored from your account contact join the [Discord Support Server](http://discord.gg/tcvd8CsA4N).  
For more information check the [Discord Terms Of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
